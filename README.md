ABOUT THE PROJECT : 
Forager is a platform that connects excess food and surplus food with people in need. 

We believe that no one should go hungry while perfectly good food goes to waste. 

Our platform brings together food donors, food banks, catering companies and food recipients in a simple and efficient way, making it easy to distribute food to those who need it most.

It will be a 'marketplace' for such occasions, where a food entity may list a food surplus, detailing food type, quantity, location etc. Users may then 'claim' posted food or join the waitlist if there is high demand. The waitlist is conditional on the current claimer not collecting food before their allocated time runs out. This way, we ensure that surplus food gets distributed efficiently to those in need.

Forager is open to all users to hop on and search for excess food supplies closest to them. Our venture is currently a non-profit, so we have no interest in monetizing this platform. We want to be part of the solution, not the problem. So, let's come together and make a difference. Thank you for listening.
